[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sasa1977/elixir-in-action.svg?branch=2nd-edition)](https://travis-ci.org/sasa1977/elixir-in-action)

This branch contains the accompanying code for Elixir in Action, Third Edition.

To compile and run the code, you'll need Elixir 1.14 and Erlang 25.x. If you're using the [asdf version manager](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf), keep in mind that this repository contains the `.tool-versions` file, specifying the Erlang and Elixir versions used to write this code. In this case you'll need to run `asdf install` in the root folder of this repository, to make sure the correct versions are installed. If you prefer to use different Elixir/Erlang versions, you can specify them in the `.tool-versions` file.

A `git` client should also be installed and available somewhere in the execution path.

The code for the second edition can be found [here](https://github.com/sasa1977/elixir-in-action/tree/edition-2).
